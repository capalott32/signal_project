The Patient Identification Subsystem ensures that incoming patient data is accurately linked to existing hospital records. This process begins when an IncomingPatientData object is received. This object contains an incomingId, a timestamp, and raw data values from an external source, such as health data simulator or real-time monitoring system.
The IdentityManager oversees the validation of incoming IDs. It uses its internal reference to a PatientIdentifier, which contains a list of HospitalPatient records. These records hold patient details such as name, ID, date of birth, and medical history. The PatientIdentifier applies matching logic using the matchPatient method to locate a corresponding hospital patient based on the provided ID.
If a valid match is found, the patient is returned and linked to the incoming data. If no match is found, the IdentityManager delegates error handling to the UnmatchedPatientLog. This class logs the unmatched ID, timestamp, and reason for the failure to support future auditing and debugging.
Additionally, PatientIdentifier can retrieve patient data dynamically using a PatientDatabaseService, which interfaces with the hospital's database. This architecture ensures robustness, traceability, and reliability in identity management for patient-linked data processing.
