The Alert Generation Subsystem of the Cardiovascular Health Monitoring System is designed to process patient health data, evaluate it against predefined thresholds, and trigger alerts in case of critical conditions. The workflow begins with the acquisition of physiological data (such as heart rate or blood pressure) represented by Signal objects. Each signal includes a type, a measured value, and a timestamp. These signals are organized into PatienrRecord entries, which store the record type, value, and associated timestamp for a particular patient.
The DataStorage class acts as the central repository, maintaining a mapping of patients via Map<Integer, Patient>. Each Patient contains a unique identified and a list of patient records. Furthermore, each patient owns a set of Threshold objects, which define acceptable ranges for different types of measurements. The relationship between Patient and Threshold is compositional, indicating that thresholds are tightly coupled to individual patients.
When new data arrives, the AlertGenerator component retrieves patient information from DataStorage and evaluates the latest records against corresponding thresholds. If a measurement exceeds the allowable range, an Alert object is instantiated containing the patient ID, the detected condition, and a timestamp. This alert is then forwarded to the AlertManager, which stores pending alerts and provides functionality to dispatch or clear them as needed. The system ensures real-time monitoring, individualized threshold evaluation, and structured alert handling to maintain clinical safetyÂ responsiveness.
